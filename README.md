Bias-Variance Tradeoff

What is Bias?
In the simplest terms, Bias is the difference between the Predicted Value and the Expected Value. To explain further, the model
makes certain assumptions when it trains on the data provided. When it is introduced to the testing/validation data, these assumptions
may not always be correct.



Predictive models have a tradeoff between bias (how well the model fits the data) and variance 
(how much the model changes based on changes in the inputs). 
Simpler models are stable (low variance) but they don't get close to the truth (high bias). 
More complex models are more prone to overfitting (high variance) but they are expressive 
enough to get close to the truth (low bias). The best model for a given problem usually lies 
somewhere in the middle.
