Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Predictive models have a tradeoff between bias (how well the model fits the data) and variance 
(how much the model changes based on changes in the inputs). 
Simpler models are stable (low variance) but they don't get close to the truth (high bias). 
More complex models are more prone to overfitting (high variance) but they are expressive 
enough to get close to the truth (low bias). The best model for a given problem usually lies 
somewhere in the middle.
